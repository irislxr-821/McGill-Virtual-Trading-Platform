# McGill-Virtual-Trading-Platform
## Description
This project aims to create "McGill Marketplace," an online trading platform that allows students to buy and sell products. It ensures a secure transaction environment through the use of university email addresses for login. The project is expected to significantly impact the student community. <br>
There are four steps. The first step involves designing the database, which includes creating an ER diagram, defining a data dictionary, and developing a rational schema. Following this, we simulate the operation by building the database with SQL, inserting mock data. Subsequently, we crafted SQL queries to mimic data retrieval in user scenarios. Finally, we showcased the results by developing a basic webpage using HTML and CSS.

## Database Design
The final database comprises 6 entities and 44 attributes. The ER diagram shown below outlines the relationships between the tables, as well as the associations of entities and attributes.
